In this directory go the actual rulebases.

Note that it contains version-specific subdirectories, where
the version denotes the version of the **rulebase format**, not
the version of liblognorm.

This versioning was introduced because we anticipate changes in
rulebase format. If this happens, it is the projects plan to either
support different formats at once or provide converters.
