# liblognorm-rulebases

The liblognorm project ( http://www.liblognorm.com ) provides high speed
text log normalization. It does so be utilizing so-called **rulebases**
which describe the content of log messages.

In this liblognorm-rulebases project we provide canned rulebases for a
variety of devices. The project's goal is to make using liblognorm as
easy as possible without the need to re-invent rulebases.

The project is currently in its infancy. Contributions are **very welcome**.
We are looking both for

* ready-to-use rulebases
* log samples

Log samples permits us to fine-tune rulebases and improve the rsyslog
tooling. When we receive samples for which no rulebase yet exists, we
try to create one.

To submit samples or rulebases, simply fork this project and send us
a pull request. Or email the project lead (Rainer Gerhards) directly
at rgerhards@adiscon.com - or use whichever other method that fits 
you best.
